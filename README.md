Open Source Contribution:
Proposal Description: 
Going through the Symbl.ai site got to know Symbl.ai provides AI based intelligent conversation APIs. from the tech stack used by Symbl.ai I have been using REACT JS for frontend development since a year and built many projects and did some contributions listed below. 
1] Eaglion Programmer‚Äôs Site - REACTJS:
An Open Source site of an open source community developed during Hacktoberfest 2021, where many members have contributed to it under my maintainership.
My Roles and Responsibilities:
1.Code base contribution for various UI components.
2.Coded responsive Navbar and Card items for homepage.
3.Reviewing other‚Äôs pull requests. 
4.Maintaining the overall project.


2] pixSearch - REACTJS:
pixSearch is a stock images web application developed using REACT JS  and Tailwind CSS.
Features:
PIXABAY API implementation for fetching and filtering data.
1.Search Images/Videos using a tag or keyword.
2.Maintaining details of Image/Video i.e Likes,Comments/Downloads/Uploaded by etc.
3.Download Images/Videos. 






3] Kubernetes: With the development of large scale applications managing them is also a great factor to maintain the software life development lifecycle. From making an application portable to  managing , monitoring and debugging it is done using container orchestration and its tools. As a devOps enthusiast I have learned many things that comes under it and currently exploring more on Go language.
Things I know in K8s and Containerization:
1.Robust Linux Basics.
2.Kubernetes ,Docker Architecture.
3.Minikube.
4.Kubectl.
5.Creating ,Running, Deploying, Monitoring and Debugging pods.
6.Creating Namespaces.
7.YAML Config files etc.
There are still many things I don't know but being a quick learner and a curious developer ,I am always ready to jump into new technologies fearlessly.
